1. Prepare a list with salesman name, customer name and their cities for the salesmen and customer who belongs to the same city

USE MAM
GO

SELECT SalesmanT.name AS Salesman_Name, CustomerT.cust_name, CustomerT.city
FROM Salesman AS SalesmanT, Customer AS CustomerT
WHERE SalesmanT.city = CustomerT.city

2. Prepare a list with order no, purchase amount, customer name and their cities for those orders which order amount between 500 and 2000.

SELECT OrdersT.ord_no AS Order_no,OrdersT.purch_amt AS Purchase_amount ,CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_name, CustomerT.city As Customer_city
FROM  Orders AS  OrdersT, Customer AS CustomerT
WHERE OrdersT.purch_amt BETWEEN 500 AND 2000

3. Write a SQL statement to know which salesman are working for which customer

SELECT SalesmanT.salesman_id AS Salesman_Id, SalesmanT.name AS Salesman_Name, CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_Name 
FROM Salesman AS SalesmanT 
INNER JOIN Customer AS CustomerT
ON SalesmanT.salesman_id = CustomerT.salesman_id

4. Find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who gets a commission from the company is more than 12%

SELECT CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_Name, SalesmanT.salesman_id AS Salesman_Id, SalesmanT.name AS Salesman_Name, SalesmanT.city AS Salesman_City, FORMAT(SalesmanT.commission,'P0') AS Salesman_Commission
FROM Salesman AS SalesmanT 
INNER JOIN Customer AS CustomerT
ON SalesmanT.salesman_id = CustomerT.salesman_id 
WHERE SalesmanT.commission > 0.12


5. Find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who does not live in the same city where their customer lives, and gets a commission is above 12%

ELECT CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_Name, SalesmanT.salesman_id AS Salesman_Id, SalesmanT.name AS Salesman_Name,CustomerT.city AS Customer_City, SalesmanT.city AS Salesman_City, FORMAT(SalesmanT.commission,'P0') AS Salesman_Commission
FROM Salesman AS SalesmanT 
INNER JOIN Customer AS CustomerT
ON SalesmanT.salesman_id = CustomerT.salesman_id 
WHERE SalesmanT.city != CustomerT.city 
AND SalesmanT.commission > 0.12

6. Find the details of a order i.e. order number, order date, amount of order, which customer gives the order and which salesman works for that customer and how much commission he gets for an order.

SELECT OrdersT.ord_no AS Order_no,OrdersT.ord_date AS Order_date, OrdersT.purch_amt AS Purchase_amount,CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_Name,SalesT.name AS Salesman_Name, FORMAT(SalesT.commission,'P0') AS Salesman_Commission
FROM  Orders AS  OrdersT
INNER JOIN Customer AS CustomerT
ON OrdersT.customer_id = CustomerT.customer_id
INNER JOIN Salesman AS SalesT
ON OrdersT.salesman_id = SalesT.salesman_id 


7. Make a join on the tables salesman, customer and orders in such a form that the same column of each table will appear once and only the relational rows will come

SELECT * 
FROM Orders AS OrdersT
NATURAL JOIN Customer
NATURAL JOIN Sales



8. Write a SQL statement to make a report with customer name, city, order no. order date, purchase amount for only those customers on the list who must have a grade and placed one or more orders 
or which order(s) have been placed by the customer who is neither in the list nor have a grade. */

SELECT CustomerT.cust_name AS Customer_Name,
       CustomerT.city,
       OrdersT.ord_no,
       OrdersT.ord_date,
       OrdersT.purch_amt
  FROM Customer AS CustomerT
  FULL OUTER JOIN Orders AS  OrdersT
    ON CustomerT.customer_id= OrdersT.customer_id
      AND CustomerT.grade IS NOT NULL;

9. Write a SQL statement to make a cartesian product between salesman and customer i.e. each salesman will appear for all customer and vice versa

SELECT SalesT.name AS Salesman_Name, CustomerT.cust_name AS 'Customer_Name'
FROM Salesman AS SalesT
CROSS JOIN Customer AS CustomerT;
